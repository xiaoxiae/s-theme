Here is an exhaustive list of hardware/software that I use, and explanations as to why.
I made it both to showcase cool software that you might have missed and for personal brainstorming purposes.

If you think there are some interesting programs that I should check out, I'd be more than happy to hear about them!

## Tools

### Editing
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) -- the ultimate text editor. Takes ~~a while~~ forever to get used to, but it's more than worth the effort.
	- [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) -- a plugin for creating Wikis. Very useful for writing things down (in Markdown syntax) and linking them together.
	- [UltiSnips](https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips) -- a plugin for creating expanding snippets.
	- [surround.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) -- a plugin for surrounding parts of text with brackets/tags. Useful for working with tag-heavy markup languages like HTML, and for bracketing in general.
	- [vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors) -- handy little plugin for managing multiple selections at once, similar to Atom and Sublime Text.
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) (for C and C++) and [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) (for C#) -- excellent multiplatform IDEs for a variety of programming languages. Made by JetBrains, a Czech company!

### Command Line
- [Ranger](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ranger) -- a text-based file manager. The controls feel quite natural to me thanks to its Vim-like key bindings.
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/) -- a (f)riendly (i)nteractive (sh)ell. Features out-of-the-box autosuggestions, has a nice scripting syntax, a [vi mode](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#fish_vi_mode), and is overall much more pleasant to work with than Bash.

### Internet Browsing
- [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) -- better than Chrome! I use it mostly for privacy concerns and for the fact that I find internet browser diversity an important issue.
	- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) -- better than Google Search (for mostly the same reason as FireFox).

#### FireFox Addons
- [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) -- moves tabs to the side of the browser, which is an absolute necessity if you're working with multiple browser tabs at the same time.
- [Vim Vixen](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vim-vixen/) -- provides relatively decent browsing with Vim-like bindings.

- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) -- an ad blocker.
- [Cookie AutoDelete](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/) -- automatically deletes cookies after closing the browser (for anti-tracking).
- [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/) -- blocks specified JavaScript code on visited websites.

### Audio/Video
- [MPV](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) -- a multiplatform media player. I switched to it from VLC, since it's much more lightweight, customizable and doesn't completely break my window manager.
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) -- a multiplatform audio editor.

### Graphics
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) -- a bitmap image editor.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) -- a vector image editor.

### Note-taking
- [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp) -- an app for taking handwritten notes that I use to manage all of my notes from my classes. Similar to OneNote, but perhaps not as polished.

### Miscellaneous
- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) -- an awesome tiling window manager that I use on my Arch Linux laptop. 
- [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) -- a decentralized cross-platform app for syncing files that I use to sync all of my data across Android, Linux and Windows, mostly without any much trouble.
